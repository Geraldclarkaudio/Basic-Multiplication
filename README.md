# Basic-Multiplication
This is a game I created for Legends if Learning. THe target student group is 3rd - 5th grade math students. Im particularly proud of this game because of some of the mechanics I implemented are some of my favorite I've ever made so far! 
The ship builder mechanics were very fun to make and I learned a lot about Cinemachine during the process.
