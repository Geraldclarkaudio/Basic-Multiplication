Garishing Worse by Michael G. Adkins

Honest font users who use this font commercially are asked to donate $5 USD at paypal.com. Send payment to the_fontry@yahoo.com. A full commercial license is available for $20 when you purchase this font at www.myfonts.com.

It does not seem probable that you would ever need another font originating from some questionable distortionary source, and yet some will ultimately click the button and add this face to their already bloating font list. But no matter the number of fonts, few people are upset with the type overload, or as just suggested, "type bloat." This is a limited freeware version, but there is a commercial version to be had, complete with foreign characters and the usual line-up of glyphical villains. There's even support for Central European diacratics, Greek, Hebrew and Cyrillic. No sense leaving entire countries out of the fun. If you do decide to buy Garishing Worse in all its glorious completeness, remember that subsidizing this font will only lead to more fonts just like this one being loosed on a public with hopelessly swollen font lists already garbing up their file managers. And that would be garish beyond comprehension.
