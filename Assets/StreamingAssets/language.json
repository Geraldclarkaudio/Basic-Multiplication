		"openingScene01": "Hey there recruit! I know you have just completed your training as a Multiplication Mastermind (MM), but we need your help ASAP!",
		"openingScene02": "Our planet's resources have been pillaged by a greedy robot called a Scion.",
		"openingScene03": "Scions travel the universe in search of resources to steal because they don't know how to use multiplication!",
		"openingScene04": "We need to get our resources back. The best way to do this is to help out the neighboring planets.",
		"openingScene05": "They will have access to the resources the Scion took from us. Perhaps they will give them to you as payment for helping them out.",
		"openingScene06": "Once we acquire all the necessary resources we can deal with that pesky Scion!",
		"scionOpening01": "Not so fast!",
		"scionOpening02": "I want to let you know that you will never catch me! I will never learn to multiply! Its too scary!",
		"openingScene07": "Alright double M. Lets get this show on the road! I'll see you at Home Base.",
		"HomeBaseIntro1": "Welcome to Home Base Recruit.",
		"HomeBaseIntro2": "From here you can select which planet to assist. First lets go help our friends in the cargo ship.",
		"HomeBaseIntro3": "I believe the Scion already got their fuel, so bring some fuel tanks. Lets go!",
		"planetSelectUIText1": "CARGO SHIP",
		"planetSelectUIText2": "PLANET 2",
		"planetSelectUIText3": "PLANET 3",
		"cargoShip1": "Thank goodness you're here!",
		"cargoShip2": "That Scion came and stole our fuel. He said something about having all the fuel means he'll never have to learn multiplication..?",
		"cargoShip3": "That was weird.",
		"cargoShip4": "Anyway. Me and my crew are floating aimlessly out here now!",
		"cargoShip5": "Our ship has 4 engines. Each engine can hold 2 tanks of fuel.",
		"cargoShip6": "Using repeated addition, we can determine how many fuel tanks we will need to fill up our ship!",
		"cargoShip7": "Repeated addition is the same thing as multiplication. The multiplicative equation for this situation looks like this.",
		"cargoShip8": "4 X 2 = 8 is the exact same thing as saying 4 groups of 2 is a total of 8.",
		"cargoShip9": "Using this approach, which equation is the repeated addition equation for 4 X 2 = 8?",
		"cargoShipCorrect": "Precisely! We need 2 fuel tanks 4 times!",
		"cargoShipIncorrect": "Not Quite. Remeber, 4 X 2 = 8 also means 4 groups of 2 = 8.",
		"cargoShipIncorrect1": "Which equation shows four groups of 2 fuel cans?",
		"cargoShipCorrect1": "Thank you for helping us! We heard the Scion stole from your home planet. We want you to have these to say thank you.",
		"resourcesReceived1": "5,000 pencils obtained!",
		"backToBase": "Back To Home Base",
		"repeatAdditionInstructions": "Drag the correct equation to the empty slot below. Which equation is the repeated addition equation for 4 X 2 = 8?",
		"welcomeBackToBase1": "Welcome back recruit. You did awesome out there.",
		"welcomeBackToBase2": "We got pencils from the cargo ship. Maybe we can catch the Scion and teach it multiplication!",
		"welcomeBackToBase3": "Lets get some more supplies from the other 2 planets. Lets go!",
		"planet1intro1": "Welcome to Cavity Planet.",
		"planet1intro2": "Depite our name, we take pride in our gorgeous teeth!",
		"planet1intro3": "The Scion who has been giving you trouble visited us, but took all of our toothbrushes!",
		"planet1intro4": "We have 5 families here. Each family has 5 members, so therefore, the Scion stole 25 toothbrushes.",
		"planet1intro5": "You could also say that we need 5 groups of 5 toothbrushes.",
		"planet1intro6": "Can you tell me which of these multiplicative sentences means 5 groups of 5 toothbrushes?",
		"planet1instructionalpanel": "Which of the following best illustrates that 5 groups of 5 = 25 total toothbrushes?",
		"wrongAnswerDialogP1": "Hmm. Not exactly. Remember, we have 5 families here with 5 members each.",
		"wrongAnswerDialogP2": "We need 25 toothbrushes. We can look at this problem like this.",
		"wrongAnswerDialogP3": "There are 5 groups of people with 5 people per group.",
		"wrongAnswerDialogP4": "Which mulitiplicative sentence makes the most sense in this situation?",
		"correctAnswerDialogP1": "Exactly! 5 X 5 means there are 5 groups of 5!",
		"correctAnswerDialogP2": "An easy way to remember that is to think of the multiplication symbol as meaning 'groups of'.",
		"correctAnswerDialogP3": "You did great! Thanks again. Now we can all go back to keeping or teeth nice and sharp and clean!,",
		"correctAnswerDialogP4": "I want you to have this paper. I heard the Scion came and took all your planet's multiplication resources.",
		"correctAnswerDialogP5": "I know it isn't much, but I think you could put this paper to better use than we can."
